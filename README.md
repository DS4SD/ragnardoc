# RAGNARDoc

RAGNARDoc (RAG Native Automatic Reingest Docs) is a tool that runs natively on a developer workstation and automatically ingests local documents into various Retrieval Augmented Generation indexes. It is designed as a companion app for workstation RAG applications which would benefit from maintaining an up-to-date view of documents hosted natively on a user's workstation.

## Future Ideas

* Auto-configure by inspecting common tools
* Per-ingestor inclusion / exclusion
* Abstract scrapers to allow non-local scraping
